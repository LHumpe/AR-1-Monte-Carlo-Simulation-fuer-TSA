# Monte-Carlo-Simulation Regarding AR(1) Properties
This repository contains R Code for a Monte-Carlo-Simulation investigating the main properties regarding autoregressive processes of order one. The resulting paper can be accessed [HERE](The_Properties_of_AR(1)_Models_-_A_Simulation_Study.pdf). The most interesting part of this project is that the simulation was conducted withou using forecasting libraries. So only libraries for output/content creation as well as for parallel computing are required. Even though only simple statistical mechanisms are investigated, implementing these helped a lot to understand the underlying dynamics of AR(1) processes and modelling.
